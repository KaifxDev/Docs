## Get Started 

To get started,

1. Go to [swiftontap.com](https://swiftontap.com) 👉.
2. Press `/` and search for a `struct`, `enum`, `func`, or any other **SwiftUI** symbol.
3. Press `return`.

We've got it all on tap. 🚰🍻

<br/>

**If you're new to SwiftUI 🤓**

We get it, docs are overwhelming at first. To start, we recommend these resources (in order!)

1. Apple's Swift [book](https://docs.swift.org/swift-book/index.html) (if you're new to the language)
2. Apple's SwiftUI [tutorials](https://developer.apple.com/tutorials/swiftui), which are quite good!
3. [SwiftOnTap](https://swiftontap.com) (these docs) once you get moving 🚴

<br/>

## How It Works

**Who wrote all these docs?**

A bunch of us SwiftUI developers have been hard at work filling Apple's documentation hole 🕳. You can also [edit these docs](#add-docs)!

<br/>

**Where do the docs live?**

All the docs live in one file called [*SwiftUI.swift*](https://github.com/SwiftOnTap/Docs/blob/main/SwiftUI.swift). It's just a regular `.swift` file with **lots** of documentation comments 🧑‍💻. Whenever anyone edits this file on [GitHub](https://github.com/SwiftOnTap/Docs), we automatically scan for the **comments**. Then it goes live to [swiftontap.com](https://swiftontap.com)!

<br/>

**Could this work for *any* `.swift` file?**

Theoretically, yes! We've just been focused writing SwiftUI docs for now. [Let us know](mailto:ben@swiftontap.com) 📧 if you want to generate your own sweet documentation site.

## Add Docs

To add or edit docs,

1. Open a **pull request** from [github.com/SwiftOnTap/Docs](https://github.com/SwiftOnTap/Docs). (See [here](https://www.freecodecamp.org/news/how-to-make-your-first-pull-request-on-github-3/) to learn how!)
2. See [this Apple guide](https://developer.apple.com/library/archive/documentation/Xcode/Reference/xcode_markup_formatting_ref/) for writing great documentation comments.
3. Sit back 🧘, and watch your work go live!
